    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a delicious classic roman pasta. It consisists of a silky cheese sauce that is made without cream. It also includes guanciale like amatriciana.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> the most common is spaghetti</li>
        <li><strong>Parmigiano Reggiano:</strong> Pecorino may be substituted</li>
        <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> an italian cured pork cheek</li>
        <li><strong>Egg Yolk and Egg White</strong> this is what gives the sauce a creamy consistency</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Black Pepper:</strong> for seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Finely grate the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino.</strong> Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta.</strong> Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook guanciale</strong> until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don't need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer into sauce bowl.</strong> Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
        <li><strong>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water</strong> into the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix vigorously</strong> with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Your carbonara is complete!</li>
    </ol>
